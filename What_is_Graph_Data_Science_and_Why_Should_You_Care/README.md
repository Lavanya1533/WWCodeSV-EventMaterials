# What is Graph Data Science and Why Should You Care?


Did you know that relationships are strong predictors of behavior and can reveal insights that would normally be hidden in your data? Graph Data Science is a science-driven approach to gain knowledge from the relationships and structures within data.

This session will introduce you to graphs and graph data science. Katie, Cynthia, and Sydney from Neo4j will explain and demonstrate the technology behind graphs, common graph use cases and how you can get started with your first project using graph technologies. You will learn about free tools and resources to continue your graph journey.
